## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get **Price Watch** running locally:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pricewatch.git
cd pricewatch
````

---

### 2. Setup the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

* Backend API runs at `http://localhost:5000`
* Handles authentication, product CRUD, price scraping, and email notifications

---

### 3. Setup the Frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

* Frontend dev server usually runs at `http://localhost:5173`
* Connects automatically to the backend API

---

### 4. Open in Browser

* Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
* Backend API (optional testing): `http://localhost:5000`

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. User logs in and receives a token
2. User adds a product URL to track
3. Backend scrapes product prices using **Playwright**
4. Price updates are stored in MongoDB
5. If price changes → user receives email notification
6. Users can view price history anytime on the dashboard
